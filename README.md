Master in Management student at Audencia (Grande Ecole), I am particularly interested in corporate finance, market finance, and green finance. I am also attentive to the role of AI, management, and economic and social transitions in our organisations.
In 2025, I joined a Franco-British double-degree with Aston Business School (Birmingham, UK), which will allow me to obtain an MSc in Financial Technology (Fintech). I am also working towards my CFA certification.

In here, I mainly work with Python, and try to explore the full potential of AI and machine learning integrations using for instance Ollama, LSTM forecasts, and qualitative analysis tools.
